/*
Okay, so I think I want this to be a text-based adventure game where you just kinda walk through a maze, encountering random enemies/items/etc.
You will create a character, maybe different classes.  No leveling up.  Very basic.  Move to a room, text appears to describe the room.  You
decide what to do in the room (open chest, fight/run, etc.) and then move on (left, right, forward, back).  Maybe dice rolls, who knows?

	// List enemy structs
	// List item structs
	// Choose your class

	return 0;
