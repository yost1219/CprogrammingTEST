There lived a certain man in Russia long ago 
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow 
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear 
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear 
He could preach the bible like a preacher 
Full of ecstacy and fire 
But he also was the kind of teacher 
Women would desire 
RA RA RASPUTIN 
Lover of the Russian queen 
There was a cat that really was gone 
RA RA RASPUTIN 
Russia's greatest love machine 
It was a shame how he carried on 
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar 
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar 
In all affairs of state he was the man to please 
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze 
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer 
Though she'd heard the things he'd done 
She believed he was a holy healer 
Who would heal her son 
RA RA RASPUTIN 
Lover of the Russian queen 
There was a cat that really was gone 
RA RA RASPUTIN 
Russia's greatest love machine 
It was a shame how he carried on
