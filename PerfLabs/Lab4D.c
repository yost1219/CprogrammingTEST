Part 1
Formatted Input (strings)

    Read a first, middle and last name as input into separate char arrays
    Specify a field-width to protect against buffer overflow
    Ensure the field-width leaves room for a nul-terminator
    Specify a ("\t") as a delimitating character

Part 2
Formatted Input (numbers)

    Read two integers from one line
    Format the input so that the integers are separated by an asterisk (*) x*y (e.g., 2*3, 11*14)
    Reprint the two integers and result as if the answer were being read by a human

////////////// EXAMPLE #1 ///////////////
OUTPUT:  Enter two integers, separated by a *, to be multiplied…
INPUT:   2*3
OUTPUT:  The result of 2 multiplied by 3 is 6.  
////////////// EXAMPLE #2 ///////////////
OUTPUT:  Enter two integers, separated by a *, to be multiplied…
INPUT:   11*14
OUTPUT:  The result of 11 multiplied by 14 is 154.
